BeatDown
========

Beatdown is an audio analysis tool for powering concerts.

Beatdown detects incoming musical properties using your Mac's microphone and then transmits MIDI to configurable channels and CCs. It is suitable for controlling both automated stage lighting (example: DMX) and VJ software.

Currently this automation is primarily in the form of the relative volume level, which could be used to dim stage lighting in response to music, etc. It may evolve to include chord detection and other features.

Tempo detection sending to MIDI clock is in progress.
