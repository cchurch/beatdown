BeatDown
========

Initial work on audio analysis tool using [pyo](http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/)
and [wxPython](https://www.wxpython.org/). Currently only captures audio level
and generates a MIDI message with velocity based on the SPL of the incoming
signal.

Only works with Python 3.5 on OSX so far.
